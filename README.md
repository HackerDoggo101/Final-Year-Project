Note: This project is still in the development stage

Speech Emotion Recognition System trained using HuBERT. 

The system was trained using 4 different Datasets, which are Tess, Savee, Ravdess, Crema. These datasets were obtained from the Kaggle website.
According to my experiments, the system is not language biased. It worked with the Mandarin language, but the emotion you express must be accurate.

I have deployed the system via Streamlit on HuggingFace spaces.<br>
